# Basic API Tests using Cucumber and HTTParty

#### Project created for testing HTTParty and fixtures-like patterns for API Testing.

#### For running the basic scenario created, one should do:

```$ bundle install```<br>
```$ bundle exec cucumber -p default```


#### The main idea is for the project to be used as a template when one wants to build simple HTTParty tests with a simple project architecture
